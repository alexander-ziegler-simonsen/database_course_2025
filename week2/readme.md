# my tools

I will be using "mermaid-cli", since I will be able to setup my diagrams fast and have version control on them.
No longer will a lot of time be spend on draging and dropping in some online/offline GUI tool, which never works as it should.

This will be so much faster and a lot more flexabile.
If the design need to change, we can just insert a new desgin config file.

```bash
# mmdc is the program
# -i is input
# -s is scale of the ouput image
# -o output and it's path
# -t is templete
# -b background

mmdc -i 001.mmd -s 5 -o /dist/001.png -t dark -b transparent
```
